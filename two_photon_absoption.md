#### 1. **Early Theoretical Foundations (1931)**
   - **Prediction by Maria Göppert-Mayer**: The phenomenon of two-photon absorption was first predicted by German-American physicist Maria Göppert-Mayer (not Mayer at the time) in 1931. In her doctoral thesis (at Gottingen, where Debye and Max Born were), she formulated the quantum mechanical theory behind multi-photon absorption, including TPA, and calculated the probability of such processes under intense light. At the time, there were no light sources intense enough to observe TPA experimentally.

This was a milestone for biomedical imaging, as TPM enabled high-resolution imaging of cells and tissues with minimal photodamage and deeper penetration.
   - **Advantages over Confocal Microscopy**: TPM quickly became a preferred imaging technique over traditional confocal microscopy for live-cell imaging, due to its ability to achieve greater imaging depth and to confine photodamage to the focal point. These advantages positioned TPM as a groundbreaking tool in neuroscience, developmental biology, and other fields.

### Two-Photon Absorption (TPA)

Two-photon absorption (TPA) is a nonlinear optical process in which two photons are simultaneously absorbed by a molecule or material, exciting an electron to a higher energy state. Unlike single-photon absorption, where a single photon provides enough energy to promote an electron, TPA requires the combined energy of two photons to bridge the energy gap. This process occurs primarily under high-intensity light sources, such as lasers.

---

#### 1. **Fundamentals of Two-Photon Absorption**

- **Basic Principle**: In TPA, two photons, typically in the visible or near-infrared range, are absorbed simultaneously, resulting in a transition to an excited state. 
- **Energy Matching**: The combined energy of the two photons must match the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state: Each photon can be of half the energy that would be required for single-photon absorption.
- **Intensity Dependence**: TPA probability is proportional to the square of the light intensity, making it a nonlinear process. Thus, TPA is more likely to occur in regions of high photon flux, such as in the focal point of a laser beam.
- **Short Lifetimes of Virtual States**: TPA involves intermediate virtual states that are not true electronic states and have very short lifetimes, requiring nearly simultaneous absorption of two photons, roughtly femtosecond latency.

---

#### 2. **Mathematical Description**

- **Rate of TPA**: The rate of two-photon absorption (\(R_{TPA}\)) is often described by:
  R_tpa proportional to delta_tpa . I^2
  where:
  - delta_TPA is the two-photon absorption cross-section, a measure of the material's ability to absorb two photons simultaneously.
  - I is the intensity of the light source.

---

#### 3. **Characteristics of TPA**

- **Threshold Intensity**: TPA requires a certain threshold of intensity to be efficient. It is typically observed with high-powered lasers where photon density is sufficiently high, because the likelihood per photon is very small.
- **Selective Excitation**: TPA allows selective excitation of fluorophores or materials in a specific region (e.g., the focal volume in microscopy), as the nonlinear absorption limits the excitation to regions of high light intensity.

---

#### 4. **Applications of Two-Photon Absorption**

- **Two-Photon Microscopy (2PM)**:
  - A powerful imaging technique in biological research, allowing for deep tissue imaging with reduced photodamage and photobleaching.
  - Uses near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths that penetrate deeper into biological samples compared to visible light.
  - Provides 3D imaging capability due to the localized excitation in the focal plane.

- **Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)**:
  - Used in medical applications to activate photosensitizers that generate reactive oxygen species for tumor or disease treatment.
  - TPA allows targeting of tissues deeper than traditional single-photon PDT, with less damage to surrounding areas.

- **Microfabrication**:
  - Enables the creation of 3D structures within photopolymers by selective polymerization through TPA.
  - Useful in producing complex microscale devices for biomedical and engineering applications.

---

#### 5. **Advantages of TPA**

- **Reduced Photodamage**: Because TPA typically uses NIR light, which is less damaging than UV or visible light, it causes less photodamage to samples.
- **Greater Penetration Depth**: NIR wavelengths penetrate deeper into materials and biological tissues, making TPA ideal for deep-tissue imaging.
- **Localized Excitation**: TPA restricts excitation to regions of high intensity, reducing out-of-focus excitation and thereby improving image contrast in microscopy.

---

#### 6. **Limitations and Challenges**

- **Need for High-Intensity Light Sources**: Effective TPA requires high-intensity laser sources, typically pulsed lasers, which sometimes don't exist for the required wavelength
- **Low TPA Cross-Section**: Many materials exhibit low TPA cross-sections, limiting the range of materials that can be effectively excited through TPA.
- **Thermal Effects**: High intensities needed for TPA can lead to localized heating, which may affect the material or biological sample integrity. Gotta work around that so that a brain scan doesn't cook your brain

---

#### 7. **Quantifying Two-Photon Absorption**

- **Two-Photon Cross-Section (δTPA)**: Measured in units called Göppert-Mayer (GM) units, with 1 GM = \(10^{-50} cm^4/photon}.
- **Measurement Techniques**:
  - **Z-scan technique**: Measures changes in transmission through a material as the focal point of a laser is moved through the sample.
  - **Fluorescence measurement**: Observes fluorescence intensity as a proxy for the TPA rate, especially in TPA microscopy setups.
